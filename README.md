# Advent of Code 2021 in APL

Hello.

This repo collects my solutions to the [2021 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) written in APL. I'm very much a neophyte with the language and will surely get stuck at some point, but I intend to collect explanations of my solutions in the explain.md to edify my learnings.
